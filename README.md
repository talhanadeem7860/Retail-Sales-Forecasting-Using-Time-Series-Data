This project tackles retail sales forecasting with a unique, non-traditional method: the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. It showcases how a time series problem can be effectively converted into a supervised regression task for prediction.

The approach hinges on feature engineering, where historical sales data is transformed using lagged values to create a feature set. A k-NN regression model is then trained on these features to predict future sales by identifying similar historical patterns. The model's accuracy is then measured using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
